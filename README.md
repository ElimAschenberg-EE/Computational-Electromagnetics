# Computational-Electromagnetics
This repository covers the computational electromagnetic projects that I, Elim Aschenberg, did at Colorado State University during the fall semester of 2025.  My code, as well as my reports, are included in this repository.  They cover everything from Method of Moments to spherical scattering.
